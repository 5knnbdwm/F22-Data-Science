### Project 1.1: Analyzing Baby Names

In this project, we will analyze the birth record from the U.S. to find interesting patterns in names given to babies.

Please follow the link below to [www.academis.eu](https://www.academis.eu/posts/data_analysis/babynames/read_data.md) and work through the 10 coding tasks.

Submit your solution by Sep 9th, preferably as a link to a GitHub repo or Google colab notebook.

Q: Do I have to complete all 10 tasks to get points?
No. Don't worry if you miss out a few.

Q: I find pandas a bit challenging. Can I use a different language?
Yes, solutions in SQL, R, Haskell, brainf*** and any language of your choice are fully valid.

Q: I find the tasks really easy. Can I do anything else?
On the page with the data, there are files for individual states. See if you can make any sense out of these.

Q: No, I want to do something that is really difficult!
OK, try any of the following:
export the code from Jupyter to a standalone Python file
clean up the code, refactor it into functions
run the code inside a Docker container

Q: Can we help each other?
Yes, this is generally a good idea in programming and life. Please indicate that in your solution.

Q: Can we ask you for help?
Yes, please reach out via Slack if you are stuck, but it might take 1-2 days.
